## 🧠 **Inspiration**
As avid travellers, we've always wanted a place to store all the memories we made and log our travel experiences into a simple online interface. A web app dedicated just for travelling, and why not make it fun? 🌈

## 💻 What it does
* **Log** : Enter all the specific memories you want to keep in Chroma World. Ranging from the most memorable restaurant you ate in, to the best souvenir you bought!
* **Laugh** : The super fun and colourful interface with different countries in different colours will excite anyone to travel more!
* **Look** : Drown yourself in memories of travelling, and look back at your achievements - how many countries did you travel to in 2021?

## 🛠 **How It Was Built**
* `html`
* `css`
* `javascript`
* `react`

## 🏃🏻 **How To Run It**
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Website should be runnning on ```localhost:3000```

## 📅 **What's next for Chroma World**
